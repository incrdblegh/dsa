# DSA
This repository contains individual solutions to some of the DSA that I covered.\
I wrote these solutions first and foremost for myself as reference material to which I can refer later whenever needed.\
Some of the more modern and/or advanced C++ techniques were omitted to simplify the solutions and better demonstrate the underlying logic of the code.
